    <h2>Description</h2>
    This Tex-Mex pizza, inspired by the beloved Taco Bell® menu item, is loaded up with fresh ingredients and bold
    flavor. Our copycat version has all the signature elements of the fast-food favorite, just bigger and beefier than
    ever. Skip the drive-thru and give our homemade spin a try for a fun and easy weeknight meal. Add any additional
    garnishes you like (such as jalapeños, sour cream, or diced avocado).
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup refried beans, warmed</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked, Mexican-seasoned ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup taco sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup red enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>½ cup diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sliced black olives</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a deep skillet over high heat. Pan-fry each tortilla turning frequently, adding
            more oil as needed, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Allow to drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble each pizza, place 4 fried tortillas on a baking sheet. Spread 3 tablespoons of refried beans
            evenly on top of every other tortilla, then add 2 to 3 tablespoons ground beef. Place the other 4 tortillas
            on top.</li>
        <li>Mix together the taco sauce and enchilada sauce in a small bowl. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the mixture on top
            of the tortillas and spread evenly. Sprinkle ¼ cup of each type of cheese evenly on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with
            diced tomatoes, black olives, green onions, and any additional garnishes. Cut into quarters, and serve
            immediately.</li>
    </ol>
