    <h2>Description</h2>
    Breaded pork chops with mashed potatoes and salad (preferably a sauerkraut salad) is served regularly for Sunday
    dinner in Poland. Pound the meat as thinly as you can for best results.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pork chops between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth
            side of a meat mallet, turning occasionally, until very thin. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour flour onto a large plate. Whisk egg in a wide, shallow bowl. Place breadcrumbs in a separate shallow
            bowl.</li>
        <li>Dredge chops with flour. Dip in whisked egg. Coat with bread crumbs on both sides. Shake off excess coating.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add breaded chops; cook until golden brown, about 5
            minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
